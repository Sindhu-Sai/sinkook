        <h4>My Design Process</h4>
<ul>
        <li>Firstly I have gone through the data files, understood the attributes of the data provided, figured out how to read the data and just do a console print. 
        I made a initial draft on paper on where and how to place svgs, what should be my order, which to plot first so that in what way it would be easy for
        me to proceed with other plots.
        Then I started drawing the map by reading streets.json file. </li>

        <li>Then I have plotted pumps on the map. Once I had them in place, I did a scatter plot on the map initially with gender to deaths.</li>
        <li>I've differentiated each death with gender individually by adding color to represent male and female. </li>

        <li>I have added zoom and pan condition on my map to zoom in and zoom out and to move the map around inside the svg defined for map. </li>
        <li>After that, I have plotted timeline graph for deaths to date and made a bar graph to show distribution of deaths over gender and age. </li>
       <li> Then I plotted the deaths on the map w.r.t to age on the maps and used colors to differentiate the age groups on the map.</li>
       <li> Finally I had the interaction taking place between map and timeline graph. </li> 
       <li>As there was only around a month to complete this project, I had to make sure that I have enough time to think over on how to plot my visualizations. </li>
   

   
      <li>I have added about, documentation, video buttons on my main visualization page that would redirect them respectively. </li>
    
     <li>   And in every above page, I have also added a button Back to visualization that would redirect to the main page. </li>
    
      <li> For interaction, when hovered on the particular day in timeline graph, deaths of until that day will be reflected on the map. </li>
      <li> Else, once the mouse moves out of the hover, then all the deaths as usual will be shown in the map </li>
    </p>
</ul>
    <h4> Why did I arrange my graphs this way?</h4>
    <p>
        The reason I chose to arrange my graphs this way was to have a specific order to myself. I felt that there were lot of modules
        that needs to be acheived in given span of 1 month. In order for me to maintain clarity on what ui am doing i this process and
        what I want show through this visualization, 
        I have drafted everything on the paper in a way what felt correct to me.

<h4> Few of the observations I have made from this project</h4>
<p>
In the distribution graph for age-sex, I observed from ages 0-10 have more female deaths than male. age>80 has the most male deaths.
Age group 11-20 has lowest deaths. <br>

<p>
More deaths were recorded near and around the pump of Broad street. For instance, 143 deaths on sep-1. Most of the deaths surrounded that pump.<br>
