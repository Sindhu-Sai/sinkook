    <h4> This project is built on 1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak</h4  >
    <p>
        My name is Sindhu Sai Sangani and here's my project on Cholera Outbreak. Using John snow map for London Cholera Outbreak as reference, I have built an interactive Visualization that would help us know the deaths caused
        by London Cholera outbreak wth respect to age, gender and dates. The data here is provided by the professor for the project and the visualization is built using this.
        This project is built using d3 which is a javascript library used for creating interactive visualizations along with HTML, CSS and JS.
